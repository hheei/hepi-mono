//! A smart, context-aware patch tool that applies diffs using fuzzy matching.
//!
//! `mpatch` is designed to apply unified diffs to a codebase, but with a key
//! difference from the standard `patch` command: it doesn't rely on strict line
//! numbers. Instead, it finds the correct location to apply changes by searching
//! for the surrounding context lines.
//!
//! This makes it highly resilient to patches that are "out of date" because of
//! preceding changes, which is a common scenario when working with AI-generated
//! diffs, code from pull requests, or snippets from documentation.
//!
//! ## Why mpatch?
//!
//! Standard patching tools are fragile. They rely on exact line numbers and
//! byte-for-byte context matches. In a modern workflow involving LLMs, code
//! often drifts quickly. `mpatch` solves this by:
//!
//! - **Flexible Anchoring**: Searching for the best fit in a file, even if the
//!   target has moved dozens of lines.
//! - **Fuzzy Similarity**: Accepting matches that are "close enough" (e.g.,
//!   modified comments or minor whitespace changes).
//! - **Indentation Awareness**: Dynamically re-aligning the indentation of
//!   injected code to match the target file's style.
//!
//! ## Format Support & Limitations
//!
//! `mpatch` handles Unified Diffs and Markdown blocks natively. It also supports
//! **Conflict Markers** (`<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>`), but with a significant caveat:
//! conflict markers do not encode the target file path. When parsed, they default
//! to a placeholder path (`patch_target`).
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! The simplest way to use `mpatch` is the one-shot [`patch_content_str()`] function.
//! It's perfect for the common workflow of taking a diff string (e.g., from an
//! LLM in a markdown file) and applying it to some existing content in memory.
//!
//! ````rust
//! use mpatch::{patch_content_str, ApplyOptions};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // 1. Define the original content and the diff.
//! let original_content = "fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n";
//! let diff_content = r#"
//! A markdown file with a diff block.
//! ```diff
//! --- a/src/main.rs
//! +++ b/src/main.rs
//! @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
//!  fn main() {
//! -    println!("Hello, world!");
//! +    println!("Hello, mpatch!");
//!  }
//! ```
//! "#;
//!
//! // 2. Call the one-shot function to parse and apply the patch.
//! let options = ApplyOptions::new();
//! let new_content = patch_content_str(diff_content, Some(original_content), &options)?;
//!
//! // 3. Verify the new content.
//! let expected_content = "fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, mpatch!\");\n}\n";
//! assert_eq!(new_content, expected_content);
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ````
//!
//! ## Applying Patches to Files
//!
//! For CLI tools or scripts that need to modify files on disk, the workflow involves
//! parsing and then using [`apply_patches_to_dir()`]. This example shows the end-to-end
//! process in a temporary directory.
//!
//! ````rust
//! use mpatch::{parse_auto, apply_patches_to_dir, ApplyOptions};
//! use std::fs;
//! use tempfile::tempdir;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // 1. Set up a temporary directory and a file to be patched.
//! let dir = tempdir()?;
//! let file_path = dir.path().join("src/main.rs");
//! fs::create_dir_all(file_path.parent().unwrap())?;
//! fs::write(&file_path, "fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n")?;
//!
//! // 2. Define the diff content, as if it came from a markdown file.
//! let diff_content = r#"
//! Some introductory text.
//!
//! ```diff
//! --- a/src/main.rs
//! +++ b/src/main.rs
//! @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
//!  fn main() {
//! -    println!("Hello, world!");
//! +    println!("Hello, mpatch!");
//!  }
//! ```
//!
//! Some concluding text.
//! "#;
//!
//! // 3. Parse the diff content to get patches.
//! let patches = parse_auto(diff_content)?;
//!
//! // 4. Apply the patches to the directory.
//! let options = ApplyOptions::new();
//! let result = apply_patches_to_dir(&patches, dir.path(), options);
//!
//! // The batch operation should succeed.
//! assert!(result.all_succeeded());
//!
//! // 5. Verify the file was changed correctly.
//! let new_content = fs::read_to_string(&file_path)?;
//! let expected_content = "fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, mpatch!\");\n}\n";
//! assert_eq!(new_content, expected_content);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ````
//!
//! ## Key Concepts
//!
//! ### The Patching Workflow
//!
//! Using the `mpatch` library typically involves a two-step process: parsing and applying.
//!
//! #### 1. Parsing
//!
//! First, you convert diff text into a structured `Vec<Patch>`. `mpatch` provides
//! several functions for this, depending on your input format:
//!
//! - [`parse_auto()`]: The recommended entry point. It automatically detects the format
//!   (Markdown, Unified Diff, or Conflict Markers) and parses the content accordingly.
//! - [`parse_single_patch()`]: A convenient wrapper around `parse_auto()` that ensures
//!   the input contains exactly one patch, returning a `Result<Patch, _>`.
//! - [`parse_diffs()`]: Scans a string for markdown code blocks containing diffs.
//! - [`parse_patches()`]: A lower-level parser that processes a raw unified diff string
//!   directly, without needing markdown fences.
//! - [`parse_conflict_markers()`]: Parses a string containing conflict markers
//!   (`<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>`) into patches.
//! - [`parse_patches_from_lines()`]: The lowest-level parser. It operates on an iterator
//!   of lines, which is useful for streaming or avoiding large string allocations.
//!
//! You can also use [`detect_patch()`] to identify the format (Markdown, Unified, or Conflict)
//! without parsing the full content.
//!
//! #### 2. Applying
//!
//! Once you have a `Patch`, you can apply it using one of the `apply` functions:
//!
//! - [`apply_patches_to_dir()`]: Applies a list of patches to a directory. This is
//!   ideal for processing multi-file diffs.
//! - [`apply_patch_to_file()`]: The most convenient function for applying a single
//!   patch to a file. It handles reading the original file and writing the new content
//!   back to disk. If the patch results in empty content, the file is deleted.
//! - [`apply_patch_to_content()`]: A pure function for in-memory operations. It takes
//!   the original content as a string and returns the new content.
//! - [`apply_patch_to_lines()`]: Similar to `apply_patch_to_content()`, but operates
//!   directly on a slice of lines, avoiding string allocations.
//!
//! Each of these also has a "strict" `try_` variant (e.g., [`try_apply_patch_to_file()`])
//! that treats partial applications as an error, simplifying the common apply-or-fail
//! workflow.
//!
//! You can also manipulate patches before application:
//!
//! - [`invert_patches()`]: Reverses a list of patches (swapping additions and deletions).
//!
//! ### Granular Application
//!
//! - [`apply_hunk_to_lines()`]: Applies a single hunk to a mutable vector of lines in-place.
//! - [`find_hunk_location()`]: Finds the location to apply a hunk to a given text content without modifying it.
//! - [`find_hunk_location_in_lines()`]: Finds the location to apply a hunk to a slice of lines without modifying it.
//!
//! ### Core Data Structures
//!
//! - [`Patch`]: Represents all the changes for a single file. It contains the
//!   target file path and a list of hunks.
//! - [`Hunk`]: Represents a single block of changes within a patch, corresponding
//!   to a block of changes (like a `@@ ... @@` section in a unified diff).
//!   For **Conflict Markers**, the "before" block is treated as deletions and the
//!   "after" block as additions.
//!
//! ### Context-Driven Matching
//!
//! The core philosophy of `mpatch` is to ignore strict line numbers. Instead, it
//! searches for the *context* of a hunk—the lines that are unchanged or being
//! deleted.
//!
//! - **Primary Search:** It first looks for an exact, character-for-character match
//!   of the hunk's context.
//! - **Ambiguity Resolution:** If the same context appears in multiple places,
//!   `mpatch` uses the line numbers (e.g., from the `@@ ... @@` header) as a *hint* to
//!   find the most likely location.
//!   Note that patches derived from **Conflict Markers** typically lack line numbers,
//!   so ambiguity cannot be resolved this way.
//! - **Fuzzy Matching:** If no exact match is found, it uses a similarity algorithm
//!   to find the *best* fuzzy match, making it resilient to minor changes in the
//!   surrounding code. It is also robust against indentation differences (e.g.,
//!   patches nested in Markdown lists).
//! - **Smart Indentation:** When applying a patch via fuzzy matching, `mpatch`
//!   dynamically adjusts the indentation of added lines to match the surrounding
//!   code in the target file, preventing style corruption.
//!
//! ## Advanced Usage
//!
//! ### Configuring [`ApplyOptions`]
//!
//! The behavior of the `apply` functions is controlled by the [`ApplyOptions`] struct.
//! `mpatch` provides several convenient ways to construct it:
//!
//! ````rust
//! use mpatch::ApplyOptions;
//!
//! // For default behavior (fuzzy matching enabled, not a dry run)
//! let default_options = ApplyOptions::new();
//!
//! // For common presets
//! let dry_run_options = ApplyOptions::dry_run();
//! let exact_options = ApplyOptions::exact();
//!
//! // For custom configurations using the new fluent methods
//! let custom_fluent = ApplyOptions::new()
//!     .with_dry_run(true)
//!     .with_fuzz_factor(0.9);
//!
//! // For complex configurations using the builder pattern
//! let custom_builder = ApplyOptions::builder()
//!     .dry_run(true)
//!     .fuzz_factor(0.9)
//!     .build();
//!
//! assert_eq!(custom_fluent.dry_run, custom_builder.dry_run);
//! assert_eq!(custom_fluent.fuzz_factor, custom_builder.fuzz_factor);
//! ````
//!
//! ### In-Memory Operations and Error Handling
//!
//! This example demonstrates how to use [`apply_patch_to_content()`] for in-memory
//! operations and how to programmatically handle cases where a patch only
//! partially applies.
//!
//! ````rust
//! use mpatch::{parse_single_patch, apply_patch_to_content, HunkApplyError};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // 1. Define original content and a patch where the second hunk will fail.
//! let original_content = "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\n\nline 5\nline 6\nline 7\n";
//! let diff_content = r#"
//! ```diff
//! --- a/partial.txt
//! +++ b/partial.txt
//! @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
//!  line 1
//! -line 2
//! +line two
//!  line 3
//! @@ -5,3 +5,3 @@
//!  line 5
//! -line WRONG CONTEXT
//! +line six
//!  line 7
//! ```
//! "#;
//!
//! // 2. Parse the diff.
//! let patch = parse_single_patch(diff_content)?;
//!
//! // 3. Apply the patch to the content in memory.
//! let options = mpatch::ApplyOptions::exact();
//! let result = apply_patch_to_content(&patch, Some(original_content), &options);
//!
//! // 4. Verify that the patch did not apply cleanly.
//! assert!(!result.report.all_applied_cleanly());
//!
//! // 5. Inspect the specific failures.
//! let failures = result.report.failures();
//! assert_eq!(failures.len(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(failures[0].hunk_index, 2); // Hunk indices are 1-based.
//! assert!(matches!(failures[0].reason, HunkApplyError::ContextNotFound));
//!
//! // 6. Verify that the content was still partially modified by the successful first hunk.
//! let expected_content = "line 1\nline two\nline 3\n\nline 5\nline 6\nline 7\n";
//! assert_eq!(result.new_content, expected_content);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ````
//!
//! ### Strict Apply-or-Fail Workflow with `try_` functions
//!
//! The previous example showed how to manually check `result.report.all_applied_cleanly()`
//! to detect partial failures. For workflows where any failed hunk should be treated as a
//! hard error, `mpatch` provides "strict" variants of the apply functions.
//!
//! - [`try_apply_patch_to_file()`]
//! - [`try_apply_patch_to_content()`]
//! - [`try_apply_patch_to_lines()`]
//!
//! These functions return a `Result` where a partial application is mapped to a
//! `Err(StrictApplyError::PartialApply { .. })`. This simplifies the common
//! apply-or-fail pattern.
//!
//! ````rust
//! use mpatch::{parse_single_patch, try_apply_patch_to_content, ApplyOptions, StrictApplyError};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let original_content = "line 1\nline 2\n";
//! let failing_diff = r#"
//! ```diff
//! --- a/file.txt
//! +++ b/file.txt
//! @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
//!  line 1
//! -WRONG CONTEXT
//! +line two
//! ```
//! "#;
//! let patch = parse_single_patch(failing_diff)?;
//! let options = ApplyOptions::exact();
//!
//! // Using the try_ variant simplifies error handling.
//! let result = try_apply_patch_to_content(&patch, Some(original_content), &options);
//!
//! assert!(matches!(result, Err(StrictApplyError::PartialApply { .. })));
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ````
//!
//! ### Step-by-Step Application with `HunkApplier`
//!
//! For maximum control, you can use the [`HunkApplier`] iterator to apply hunks
//! one at a time and inspect the state between each step.
//!
//! ````rust
//! use mpatch::{parse_single_patch, HunkApplier, HunkApplyStatus, ApplyOptions};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // 1. Define original content and a patch.
//! let original_lines = vec!["line 1", "line 2", "line 3"];
//! let diff_content = r#"
//! ```diff
//! --- a/file.txt
//! +++ b/file.txt
//! @@ -2,1 +2,1 @@
//! -line 2
//! +line two
//! ```
//! "#;
//! let patch = parse_single_patch(diff_content)?;
//! let options = ApplyOptions::new();
//!
//! // 2. Create the applier.
//! let mut applier = HunkApplier::new(&patch, Some(&original_lines), &options);
//!
//! // 3. Apply the first (and only) hunk.
//! let status = applier.next().unwrap();
//! assert!(matches!(status, HunkApplyStatus::Applied { .. }));
//!
//! // 4. Check that there are no more hunks.
//! assert!(applier.next().is_none());
//!
//! // 5. Finalize the content.
//! let new_content = applier.into_content();
//! assert_eq!(new_content, "line 1\nline two\nline 3\n");
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ````
//!
//! ### Creating Patches
//!
//! You can also use `mpatch` to generate patches by comparing two strings using
//! [`Patch::from_texts()`].
//!
//! ````rust
//! use mpatch::Patch;
//!
//! let old_text = "fn main() { println!(\"Old\"); }";
//! let new_text = "fn main() { println!(\"New\"); }";
//!
//! // Create a patch with 3 lines of context
//! let patch = Patch::from_texts("src/main.rs", old_text, new_text, 3).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!(patch.hunks.len(), 1);
//! ````
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! `mpatch` includes the following optional features:
//!
//! ### `parallel`
//!
//! - **Enabled by default.**
//! - This feature enables parallel processing for the fuzzy matching algorithm using the
//!   [`rayon`](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) crate. When an exact match for a hunk
//!   is not found, `mpatch` performs a computationally intensive search for the best
//!   fuzzy match. The `parallel` feature significantly speeds up this process on
//!   multi-core systems by distributing the search across multiple threads.
//!
//! - **To disable this feature**, specify `default-features = false` in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!   ```toml
//!   [dependencies]
//!   mpatch = { version = "1.6.4", default-features = false }
//!   ```
//!   You might want to disable this feature if you are compiling for a target that
//!   does not support threading (like `wasm32-unknown-unknown`) or if you want to
//!   minimize dependencies and binary size.

///
/// 1.  **Markdown:** Code blocks fenced with backticks (e.g., ` ```diff `) containing

/// 2.  **Unified Diff:** Standard diffs containing `--- a/path` and `+++ b/path` headers.

///
/// ## Behavior
///
/// The function first attempts to detect the format using lightweight heuristics
/// (see [`detect_patch`]).
///
/// - If **Markdown** is detected, it extracts patches from all valid code blocks.
/// - If **Unified Diff** headers are detected, it parses the entire string as a raw diff.
/// - If **Conflict Markers** are detected, it parses the blocks into patches targeting a generic file path.
/// - If the format is **Unknown**, it attempts to parse the content as a raw diff
///   as a fallback. This allows parsing fragments that might lack full file headers
///   but contain valid hunks.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `content` - A string slice containing the patch data to analyze.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` containing a vector of [`Patch`] objects on success.
///
/// # Errors
///

/// (e.g., a unified diff missing file headers).

/// Applies a single hunk to a mutable vector of lines in-place.
///
/// This function provides granular control over the patching process, allowing library

/// directly based on the changes defined in the `hunk`.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `hunk` - The [`Hunk`] to apply.
/// * `target_lines` - A mutable vector of strings representing the file's content.
///   This vector will be modified by the function.
/// * `options` - Configuration for the patch operation, such as `fuzz_factor`.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A [`HunkApplyStatus`] indicating the outcome:
/// - [`HunkApplyStatus::Applied`]: The hunk was successfully applied. The `location` and `match_type` are provided.
/// - [`HunkApplyStatus::SkippedNoChanges`]: The hunk contained only context lines and was skipped.
/// - [`HunkApplyStatus::Failed`]: The hunk could not be applied. The reason is provided in the associated [`HunkApplyError`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # use mpatch::{parse_single_patch, apply_hunk_to_lines, ApplyOptions, HunkApplyStatus, HunkLocation, MatchType};
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

/// This function encapsulates the core context-aware search logic of `mpatch`. It
/// performs a series of checks, from exact matching to fuzzy matching, to determine
/// the optimal position to apply the hunk. It is a read-only operation.
///
/// This is useful for tools that want to analyze where a patch would apply without
/// actually performing the patch, or for building custom patch application logic.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// **Note:** For improved performance when content is already available as a slice
/// of lines, consider using [`find_hunk_location_in_lines()`].
///
/// * `hunk` - A reference to the [`Hunk`] to be located.
/// * `target_content` - A string slice of the content to search within.
/// * `options` - Configuration for the patch operation, such as `fuzz_factor`.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A tuple containing the [`HunkLocation`] and the [`MatchType`] on success.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `Err(`[`HunkApplyError`]`)` if no suitable location could be found, with a reason
/// for the failure (e.g., context not found, ambiguous match).
