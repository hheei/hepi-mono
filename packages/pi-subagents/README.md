# @hheei/pi-subagents

Run several independent Pi child sessions from one Pi session, each with its own Pi session
file, its own runtime, and its own durable identity.

The package is a single concrete extension with one `pi.extensions` entry
(`dist/extension.js`). The same entry runs on both sides: the parent branch registers the
model-facing tools, commands, compact footer status, and info entries; the child branch registers only the reporting
bridge and session-leave reporting.

## Parent tools

The extension registers no global keyboard shortcuts. Use `/subagents` to manage
children and `/subagents stop [id]` to stop one without conflicting with other extensions.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agents_delegate({ task, agent?, id?, cwd?, wait? })` | Delegate work to a new agent (`agent`) or continue an existing one (`id`, which wins over `agent`). Omit `id` to create an agent: Pi assigns the id, so an unknown or blank id is never a way to create one. A new child runs in a new Herdr tab (or cmux surface) targeting the parent's workspace when a host is available, and headless in the background otherwise. **Prefer reusing existing agents** via `id` for related/follow-up work to keep context and maximize prompt-cache and memory efficiency. The tool description lists available agent names and roles, excluding disabled or hidden definitions. Deferred by default; discover via `tool_search({ query: "agent" })`. `wait:true` (default) returns the settled delegation, `wait:false` returns it as soon as it is accepted; either way the result arrives automatically, so do not poll. |
| `agents_get({ id, revision?, includeOutput? })` | Read one delegation of an agent: the newest by default, `revision` for one specific delegation, and the result body only with `includeOutput: true` (bounded by the shared output limit). The view carries the delegation `status` and the runtime `progress.runtimeState` separately, so a new delegation never overwrites a historical result. From the second successful inspection of the same agent in this parent runtime, the result adds a short reminder that results return automatically and must not be polled. Deferred by default; discover via `tool_search({ query: "agent" })`. |
| `agents_stop({ id })` | Stop one agent's runtime by id. Open delegations end as failed; finished results and the session are kept, so a later `agents_delegate` with this id resumes it. Deferred by default; discover via `tool_search({ query: "agent" })`. |
| `agents_dashboard({})` | Summarise this session's agents: runtime counts plus each agent's latest delegation status and activity, never result bodies. Deferred by default; discover via `tool_search({ query: "agent" })`. |

### Unified Task Management

`agents_delegate` returns `{ id, revision, status, task, hasOutput }`: `revision` identifies that
delegation of the agent, and a settled delegation carries its result when `wait` is true.
`agents_stop` returns the same projection for the agent it stopped. Failures return only their
reason. There is no public `title` or `mode`: the child session title is derived from the agent name
and id, and continuing an agent always steers.

SubagentManager and its SQLite ledger own child conversation state, runtime leases, recovery, and reports. No pi-ext-tools task service is required. Only delivery batching is shared through ext-core BackgroundDelivery. Child reports arrive automatically; do not poll status to detect completion. Bash uses separate `bg_bash_*` tools. Deferred agent tools are loaded via `tool_search`; `before_agent_start` writes the `subagents` bullet into the structured prompt's `optional_tools` section. Diagnostics describe blockers, failed turns, or uncertain runtime state.

## Child execution and reporting

Subagents communicate with the parent through the `commands` table in `state.sqlite`, with each child holding a SQLite process lock that proves its writer is alive:

- **Completion by Direct Output**: Subagents do **not** need to call any reporting tool upon successful completion. The subagent simply outputs its final answer as normal assistant text.
- **Settlement Batching**: When a subagent settles, the harness captures the trailing assistant text and delivers it to the parent conversation as a `subagent-report`. Reports flush within 500ms when no other child is working, and are batched for up to 10 seconds while another child is still running.
- **Blockers & Decisions**: The child registers `contact_parent({ message, reason? })` strictly for reporting when it is blocked or urgently requires a parent decision midway (`reason` defaults to `'blocked'`). Blocked reports wake the parent immediately.
- **Direct `/compact` Command**: Sending `"/compact"` (or `"/compact [instructions]"`) via `agents_delegate` intercepts the command on the child side without passing it as prompt text to the LLM. The child executes native context compaction and reports completion status back to the parent via `contact_parent`. Duplicate `/compact` requests while a compaction is already in flight are safely acknowledged and ignored.
- **Context Trim Hint**: When a subagent completes a task with context usage exceeding 100,000 tokens, its report includes a hint advising the parent to trim memory via `agents_delegate({ id, task: "/compact" })` if the child session will be retained for future work.
- **Automatic Retry**: Pi's own auto-retry is observed, not invented: reports are suppressed while a retry is in flight, and a retry that succeeds clears the previous error instead of reporting it.
- **Panel Failure Auto-Close**: When a subagent running in a panel encounters a fatal error or reports a blocker, the manager starts a 15-second countdown after notifying the parent, automatically closing the panel tab to avoid workspace clutter unless new instructions are dispatched.
## Compact status and reports

Running children use the native Pi status line: `🤖 󰪠#21 #22 #23`. With pi-status installed, this appears at the bottom right before the existing TODO segment, separated by ` ‧ `. Display shorthand `#21` refers to tool ID `agent-21`. No running children means no agent segment; no multi-line parent widget is mounted.

Confirmed done, error, and blocked reports appear once as `subagent-info` transcript entries. Collapsed entries show the outcome, child ID, and agent name; expand to read the complete report. They survive resume and do not enter model context. The original automatic `subagent-report` still reaches the model, with its duplicate transcript display hidden. Transient errors remain subject to settlement and retry checks before reporting.

Use `/subagents` for complete status and management. `agents_delegate` with an existing `id` can resume a done, blocked, errored, or stopped child with its session context intact; retrying does not guarantee the underlying failure is resolved.

## Host Integration and Isolation

- **Herdr Workspace Affinity**: When spawning in Herdr, tabs are explicitly created in the parent process's current workspace (`--workspace <WORKSPACE_ID>`), preventing child tabs from jumping to whichever workspace happens to have user focus.
- **Memory Isolation**: Both `PI_HINDSIGHT_DISABLE=1` and `PI_OBSERVATIONAL_MEMORY_DISABLE=1` are injected into child processes. Hindsight memory auto-registration, recall, and writeback are disabled, and the child bridge blocks all `mcp__hindsight__*` calls. Background Observational Memory workers (observation, reflection, compaction triggers) are suppressed in passive mode.

## Agent definitions

Agent Markdown files are discovered in this order, most specific first, by `name`:

```text
<cwd>/.pi/agents/*.md
<cwd>/.pi/agents/*.md
~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md
```

Frontmatter is parsed with Pi's `parseFrontmatter` and validated against this package's schema. Supported fields: `name`, `display_name`, `description`, `hidden`, `model`, `thinking`, `tools`, `exclude_tools`, `extensions`, `skills`, `mcp`, `codemode`.

### Unified Resource Selection (Pi Semantics)

`tools`, `skills`, and `mcp` follow Pi's unified selection semantics:

- **`boolean` toggle**:
  - `true` (or omitted): Full inheritance from host defaults.
  - `false`: Completely disabled (passes `--no-mcp`, `--no-skills`, `--no-tools` respectively; `--no-mcp` physically shuts down the MCP subsystem so no server processes or network connections start).
  - MCP selection (`mcp: [server1]`) acts at the tool exposure and execution boundary via `--tools` / `--exclude-tools` patterns and child-bridge tool call gating. Non-whitelisted or excluded server tools cannot be viewed or called.
- **Exact list (Whitelist / Replace)**:
  - `[item1, item2]`: Activates only the named entries.
- **Incremental modifiers (`+` / `-`)**:
  - `["+itemA", "-itemB"]`: Adds or excludes entries relative to base defaults. Exact names and modifiers cannot be mixed.

### Built-in Agents

- **`scout`**: Read-only reconnaissance agent. Disabled by default until the user explicitly configures a model in `~/.pi/agent/agents/scout.md`.
- **`worker`**: General implementation agent. Configured with `model: inherit` to inherit the parent session's model and thinking level.
- **`reviewer`**: Code review agent. Configured with `model: inherit` and leverages skill discovery to run review skills.
